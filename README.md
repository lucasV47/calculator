# Simple Java Calculator 

This is a simple console-based calculator implemented in Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

##  Features
- Accepts two numerical inputs from the user.
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Prevents division by zero.
- Continuously allows calculations until the user chooses to exit.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

##  How to Use
1. Run the program in a terminal or an IDE that supports Java.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. Choose an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. The result will be displayed.
5. Choose whether to perform another calculation (`y` for yes, any other key to exit).

##  Installation & Execution
1. Clone the repository or download the `Calculator.java` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```sh
   javac Calculator.java
